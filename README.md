# Stonks - StockSandbox

## Brief Application Description
- Our application features a fictional stock market using fake money, the stocks are based on real stocks for the prices and fluctuations. When a user logs in they are given a certain amount of starting cash which they can use to invest in the market. The application will track their stocks, allowing them to cash out whenever they want. Their profits or losses will be tracked as well, allowing them to see how effective they have been.
- There are pages for login, registration, portfolio and user profile, watchlist and order history, and a leaderboard where the top investors are ranked. These pages are connected via a header UI, allowing users to easily navigate through the page.
